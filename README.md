# vim-pets ðŸ¦–

Snippets like regexp-based abbreviations for Vim.

Provides lightweight and general alternative to plugins like:
- [vim-endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise),
- [pear-tree](https://github.com/tmsvg/pear-tree),
- [auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs),
- [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips).


## How?

You: Give a regexp pattern and a text that it should be replaced for.

Plugin: Does this substitution when pattern matches end-of-line.
